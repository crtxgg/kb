{% hint style="info" %}
**MacOS only** : At first launch, Cortex will ask your permission to use the _Accessibility features_. **You will have to enable it once** \(via System Preferences -&gt; Security & Privacy -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Accessibility\) **and restart Cortex**. 
{% endhint %}

## Update

Cortex tries to update itself on every launch. Just sit back and relax.
